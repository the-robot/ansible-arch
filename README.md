# Ansible setup for Arch based distros

## 1. Installation

**NOTE:** this setup is made for myself so you will need to edit the ansible config for your own use.

Run the command below to automatically setup the arch linux with ansible playbook.

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-robot/ansible-arch/master/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- <normal_username>
```

## 2. Contribution

Follow [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) for formatting the bash script.

## 3. To Add Later
