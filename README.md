# Ansible setup for Arch based distros

## 1. Installation

**NOTE:** this setup is made for myself so you will need to edit the ansible config for your own use. For example, changing some paths and username from `local.yml`.

Run the command below to automatically setup the arch linux with ansible playbook.

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-robot/ansible-arch/master/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash
```

## 2. Contribution

Follow [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) for formatting the bash script.
